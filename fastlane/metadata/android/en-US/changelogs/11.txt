Lemmynade is now available on the [play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zachatrocity.lemmynade) and [f-droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.zachatrocity.lemmynade)

### Changed

- Posts with large amount of text are now truncated in infinite scroll views
- Changed image viewer dismissal to be more fun. The image now also moves on the x axis, changes scale and rotates a bit for more user enjoyment

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where the "About lemmynade" tile would not appear on Windows/Linux
- Added a bigger bottom margin in the comment section to prevent the floating action button from covering the last comment
