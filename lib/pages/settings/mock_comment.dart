I will be traveling for five days, returning to my current location on day 3 and traveling again on the last two days. I will not poop on the first three days (hopefully).\n\n- Clean toilets with all the expected facilities **will** be available to me. I am not going to poop for reasons that I wish to keep to myself.\n\n- If it gets bad, like really bad, like a-piece-of-poop-is-literally-halfway-out-my-ass bad, I will use the toilets.\n\n\nPlease stop asking because I am not telling anyone the reason.",
